2-24-2020: PHP Login form is up and running, the mySQL Database now works.  The PHP files took forever to get functional, but all tested features work.  Session expiring feature hasn't  been tested.

2-25-2020: Added a sign up page that inserts data into the mySQL server.  It takes in first and last name, username, password, email and profile picture.  Still need to figure out how to make it mandatory because currently, all information in the form is optional.  Not a hard fix, but it's 2am.
