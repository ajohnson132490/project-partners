Project Partners is a website designed to help people find like-minded individuals to work on projects with.

2-24-2020: PHP Login form is up and running, the mySQL Database now works.  The PHP files took forever to get functional, but all tested features work.  Session expiring feature hasn't  been tested.

2-25-2020: Added a sign up page that inserts data into the mySQL server.  It takes in first and last name, username, password, email and profile picture.  Still need to figure out how to make it mandatory because currently, all information in the form is optional.  Not a hard fix, but it's 2am.

2-26-2020: Austin made it so that all fields are mandatory except for the profile picture.  Then Austin spent way too long trying to auto insert a default picture.  Better idea is to load the default picture in the profile page if the field is empty.  But auto insertion would be better in the long run.

2-27-2020: Austin created the profile page that displays all the users information.  It pulls info straight off of the database.  Still working on displaying the image.

3-11-2020: Austin is creating a project page, but is struggling to create a flexible system.

3-19-2020: Austin has created a second database to store all projects.  new-project.php is a form page used to create new projects under the current users ownership. project.php will probably be deleted soon because I'm not sure what it's for.  Current goals are to work on aesthetic, create a dashboard, and dynamically load projects into the profile page for viewing.  

  Austin also brought Seth and Olivia on board.
